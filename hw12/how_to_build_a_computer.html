    can be a difficult thing. You might not even know where to
    start. I wanted make something to get you started on what

    <p>The first thing you'll need to start with is figuring out
    what you want the computer to be used for, gaming, work, 
    editing photos. What you choose will decide a lot of the
    components you'll want to get. As well as the price 
    range you'll find yourself in.
    </p>

    <p>A good place to start doing some research on what price and 
    hardware you'll need for the kind of PC you want to build.
